# Veggie

 Veggie is a React JS-driven vegetable ecommerce platform, supported by Django and PostgreSQL. Users can effortlessly sign up, explore a range of farm-fresh produce, and seamlessly manage their carts. Our streamlined checkout process and real-time order tracking make shopping a breeze. We take pride in acknowledging local farmers, creating a connection between consumers and sustainable agriculture. Veggie is more than a website; it's a digital marketplace where technology meets the roots of nature.
